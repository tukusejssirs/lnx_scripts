## `/etc/hosts`
I use @StevenBlack’s `hosts` from his [`hosts`](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) repo, specifically `alternates/fakenews-gambling-porn/hosts`.

I cloned the repo and symlinked it to `/etc/hosts`—thus every time a new version is released, all I have to do is `git pull` in the cloned repo. :)
